# Deep Learning-Based Fault Detection System for Structural Defects in Nano-Quadcopters

This repository contains the code and resources for our research project on developing a deep learning model to detect structural defects in nano-quadcopters, particularly the Crazyflie 2.1. The model aims to enhance the safety and performance of UAVs by identifying faults in real-time using advanced neural network techniques.
